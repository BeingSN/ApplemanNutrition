                        working as a Clinical Dietitian at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. There, she was able to use
                        her Medical Nutrition Therapy background to work with a wide variety of patients, primarily
                        those with oncologic and gastrointestinal needs. Carrie continues to counsel patients in an
                        acute care setting as a senior and supervising clinician. Working in a clinical setting has
                        reinforced Carrie’s core belief that balanced nutrition plays a critical role in both the

                        foods fit’ mentality. She is an experienced nutrition educator in the community and has
                        discussed a multitude of nutrition and wellness topics with adolescents and young adults as well
                        as in corporate settings. Carrie has also devoted her time and expertise over the course of
